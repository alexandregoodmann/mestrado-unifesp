The Hough Circle Transform is a technique used in computer vision and image processing to detect circles in images. Similar to the Hough Line Transform, it operates by identifying points in an image that could potentially lie on a circle. The algorithm then accumulates evidence for possible circle centers and radii through a voting process in a parameter space.

Here's a brief mathematical explanation of how the Hough Circle Transform works:

1. **Edge Detection**: Before applying the Hough Circle Transform, it's common to perform edge detection on the image using techniques like the Canny edge detector. This helps in reducing the amount of information and focusing on the most relevant parts of the image.

2. **Parameter Space**: The Hough Circle Transform works in a parameter space defined by the circle's center coordinates (x, y) and its radius (r). Each point (x, y) in the input image casts a vote for possible circle parameters (x_center, y_center, r) that could represent circles containing that point.

3. **Voting**: For each edge pixel in the edge-detected image, a set of circles passing through that pixel is considered. For each such circle, a vote is cast in the parameter space corresponding to the circle's center and radius. This is typically done by incrementing a accumulator array at the corresponding (x_center, y_center, r) position.

4. **Accumulation**: After processing all edge pixels, the accumulator array will contain peaks indicating potential circles in the image. The peaks represent the center and radius of the circles that received the most votes.

5. **Thresholding and Post-processing**: To extract the circles from the accumulator array, thresholding is often applied to identify significant peaks. These peaks correspond to circles detected in the image. Additionally, post-processing steps such as non-maximum suppression may be used to refine the detected circles and remove duplicates.

6. **Detection**: Once the circles are detected, they can be overlaid on the original image for visualization or further analysis.

Mathematically, the Hough Circle Transform can be expressed as an equation for a circle:

\[ (x - x_c)^2 + (y - y_c)^2 = r^2 \]

Where:
- \( (x, y) \) are the coordinates of a point in the image.
- \( (x_c, y_c) \) are the coordinates of the circle's center.
- \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

The accumulator space is typically discretized due to computational limitations. Each cell in the accumulator array corresponds to a specific combination of circle parameters. By accumulating votes in this space, the algorithm can efficiently detect circles in the image.
